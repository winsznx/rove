# Rove — Agent-Native Binance Execution-Path Compiler

Rove lets a Binance user describe the economic outcome they want without forcing them to manually choose the Binance product first.

The memorable mechanism is:

> **compile → reject → rank → confirm**

The primary product artifact is the **Route Card**.

---

## 1. When to Use Rove

Use Rove whenever the user expresses an economic or trading intent involving Binance:
- Buying or selling tokens (e.g. "Buy $750 of BNB", "Sell 2.5 ETH with lowest fee")
- Hedging exposure without disposing of assets (e.g. "Hedge 70% of my BNB for 24h, don't sell my BNB, keep leverage below 1.5x")
- Flattening exposure or offsetting positions
- What-if constraint updates (e.g. "Same hedge, but cap carry at 10 bps")

---

## 2. Critical Architecture Rule

- **Language intelligence belongs to the host agent.**
- **Financial correctness belongs to deterministic Rove code.**

### The host model may:
1. Compile user statements into typed `ExecutionIntent`.
2. Ask the minimum decision-changing clarifying question if required inputs are missing.
3. Explain deterministic results and Route Cards to the user.

### The host model MUST NOT authoritatively perform:
- Fee arithmetic
- Slippage calculation
- Order-book walking
- Leverage computation
- Funding carry projection
- Route eligibility
- Route ranking
- Order sizing or final order request construction

All quantitative, financial, constraint, and ranking logic is strictly performed by deterministic code in `@rove/core`.

## 3. The 4-Step Operational Flow

### Step 1: Compile Intent
Compile user natural language into an `ExecutionIntent` object:
```json
{
  "version": "1",
  "objective": "buy | sell | hedge | flatten",
  "asset": "BNB",
  "amount": { "type": "notional", "value": "750", "currency": "USDT" },
  "horizon": { "value": 24, "unit": "hours" },
  "must_retain_underlying": true,
  "max_leverage": "1.5",
  "max_estimated_carry_bps": "10.0",
  "max_observed_execution_cost_bps": "8.0",
  "urgency": "normal"
}
```

If a decision-changing field is missing, ask **one concise question**:
- *Good*: "What portion of your BNB exposure should I hedge?"
- *Bad*: "What is your risk tolerance, investment horizon, portfolio strategy, and preferred execution method?"

### Step 2: Price & Reject
Rove captures live comparison state across eligible products from Binance Agent OS within a bounded time window (`<= 2000 ms` skew):
- **Spot**: Walk live order book, compute VWAP slippage + authoritative account commission.
- **Convert**: Real-time RFQ quote spread delta.
- **USD-M Perpetual**: Mark price execution fee + projected funding carry over horizon.
- **Margin / COIN-M**: Evaluated against live account enablement; if disabled, rejected cleanly as `PRODUCT_UNAVAILABLE`.

Deterministic constraints are enforced:
- `must_retain_underlying=true` rejects routes that dispose of the protected asset (`RETAIN_UNDERLYING_CONFLICT`).
- Leverage cap enforcement (`LEVERAGE_LIMIT`).
- Cost ceiling enforcement (`EXECUTION_COST_LIMIT`).
- Carry ceiling enforcement (`CARRY_LIMIT`).
- Stale quote detection (`QUOTE_EXPIRED`).

### Step 3: Deterministic Ranking
Surviving paths are ranked without arbitrary AI scores:
1. Hard constraints pass
2. Complete required cost data
3. Lower observed immediate execution cost
4. Lower estimated carry under the declared scenario
5. Fresher quote
6. Operational complexity tie-break (Convert > Spot > USD-M)

### Step 4: Route Card Presentation & User Approval
Render the Route Cards to the user. Always separate **Observed Now** from **Estimated Over Horizon**.

Before any consequential order is sent:
1. Revalidate route freshness.
2. Require explicit human confirmation.
3. Keep `ROVE_ENABLE_LIVE_TRADE=false` unless explicitly approved.
4. Record the final `ExecutionReceipt`.
